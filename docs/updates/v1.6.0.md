# Migration

This guide only applies if you are updating from a version of PicoLimbo prior to 1.6.0.

## Spawn Dimension

Spawn dimension has been moved to the `world` section and renamed from `spawn_dimension` to `dimension`:

```toml
spawn_dimension = "overworld" # [!code --]
[world] # [!code ++]
dimension = "overworld" # [!code ++]
```

[See docs](../config/world.md#dimension)

## Spawn Position

Spawn position has been moved to the `world` section as it works with all versions:

```toml
[experimental.world] # [!code --]
[world] # [!code ++]
spawn_position = [0.0, 320.0, 0.0]
```

[See docs](../config/world.md#spawn-position)

## View Distance

View distance has been moved to the `world.experimental` section:

```toml
[experimental.world] # [!code --]
[world.experimental] # [!code ++]
view_distance = 2
```

[See docs](../config/schematic-loading.md#view-distance)

## Schematic File

Schematic file has been moved to the `world.experimental` section:

```toml
[experimental.world] # [!code --]
[world.experimental] # [!code ++]
schematic_file = ""
```

[See docs](../config/schematic-loading.md#schematic-file)

## Forwarding

While the old forwarding configuration format is still accepted, it is recommended to update your configuration file to the new format which represents best the reality.

### Velocity Modern Forwarding

```toml
[forwarding.velocity] # [!code --]
enabled = true # [!code --]
[forwarding] # [!code ++]
mode = "MODERN" # [!code ++]
secret = "<your-secret>"
```

[See docs](../config/proxy-integration.md#velocity-modern-forwarding)

### BungeeGuard Legacy Forwarding

```toml
[forwarding.bungee_cord] # [!code --]
enabled = true # [!code --]
bungee_guard = true # [!code --]
[forwarding] # [!code ++]
mode = "BUNGEE_GUARD" # [!code ++]
tokens = ["<token1>", "<token2>", ...]
```

[See docs](../config/proxy-integration.md#bungeeguard-authentication)

### BungeeCord Legacy Forwarding

```toml
[forwarding.bungee_cord] # [!code --]
enabled = true # [!code --]
bungee_guard = false # [!code --]
tokens = [] # [!code --]
[forwarding] # [!code ++]
mode = "LEGACY" # [!code ++]
```

[See docs](../config/proxy-integration.md#bungeecord-legacy-forwarding)

### No Forwarding

[forwarding] # [!code ++]
mode = "NONE" # [!code ++]
```
