# PicoLimbo Configuration Guide

Welcome to the PicoLimbo configuration documentation. This guide will help you customize your server to meet your specific needs.

## Version Support

Some features display a badge with a version number, such as <Badge type="warning" text="1.13+" />. This indicates the minimum client version required by the feature.

If no badge is present, the feature is supported across all versions.
