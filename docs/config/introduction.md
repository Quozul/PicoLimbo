# PicoLimbo Configuration Guide

Welcome to the PicoLimbo configuration documentation. This guide will help you customize your server to meet your specific needs.

## Configuration Overview

PicoLimbo uses a simple TOML configuration file to manage all server settings. The configuration is organized into several sections:

- [Server Settings](./server-settings) - Core server configuration
- [Server List Settings](./server-list) - Customize your server's appearance in the Minecraft client
- [Forwarding Proxy Settings](./proxy-integration) - Configure proxy integration
- [World Settings](./world) - Configure the world
